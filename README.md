# Distributed_Systems_2022

This is a project for Distributed Systems course in the fall of 2022 at Helsinki University.
Project goal is to build a simple distributed system.

__Project minimum requirements:__
* at least 3 nodes
* Shared distributed state 
* 3 of the following: Naming and node discovery, Synchronization and consistency, Fault tolerance, Consensus

__Requirements for nodes:__
1. be running on a separate computer / virtual machine
2. have its own IP-address
3. communicate with at least two other nodes only by using Internet protocol based message exchange
4. be able to express their state and/or readiness for sessions towards other nodes

Additional features: scalability and performance
* Scalability and performance of your system has to be addressed in the final report. You do not need to
  design these features in the system, but simply to discuss the system also from these viewpoints.
